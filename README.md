# VisualAid
Visual Aid is an android app which enables the blind and visually impaired persons get information about objects in their environment.
Visual Aid identifies the objects via a phone camera whereby the app icon is clicked and the rear camera opens to view the object and on tapping the object viewed  (or bounding box surrounding the object), a voice is generated identifying the object and thus delivering an idea about the object to the user. It uses the ssd_mobilenet_v1 architecture for object detection.
The model is saved as a .tflite file in the assets folder along with the labels.
